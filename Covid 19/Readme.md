# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data using Python.  
The goal is to understand trends in confirmed cases, deaths, testing, and vaccinations through clean and meaningful visualizations.

The dataset used is a real-world global COVID-19 dataset containing country-wise and date-wise information.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Total COVID-19 cases and deaths over time
- Daily new cases vs smoothed trends
- Country-specific analysis (e.g., India)
- Comparison between total cases and deaths
- Handling large-scale data and missing values

---

## 📈 Visualizations
All visualizations are created using **Seaborn** for better clarity and aesthetics:
- Line plots for time-series trends
- Comparative graphs for cases vs deaths
- Cleaned axes to handle large numerical values (millions scale)

---

## 🧠 Learnings
- How to work with large real-world datasets
- Importance of data cleaning before visualization
- Understanding time-series data behavior
- Interpreting insights rather than just plotting graphs

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
This project concludes my Python-based data analysis phase.  
Next, I will focus on:
- Excel for data analysis
- SQL for querying data
- Power BI for interactive dashboards

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Testing data
- Vaccination statistics
- Demographic indicators
