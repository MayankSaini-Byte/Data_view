# 📊 School Data Science Bootcamp (Classes 8–10)

## Overview

This project is designed as a **School-Level Data Science Bootcamp** for students of **Classes 8, 9, and 10**. The objective is to introduce students to **data thinking, analysis, and visualization** using real-world school data in a structured, beginner-friendly manner.

The bootcamp follows a **step-by-step analytics pipeline**, similar to how data is handled in real organizations, while keeping the tools and concepts accessible for school students.
