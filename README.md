📊 Data Visualization & Analysis — Learning Repository
📌 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey in data analysis and data visualization using Python.
It contains beginner-to-intermediate level notebooks focused on understanding data, visualizing patterns, and extracting basic insights.

The goal is learning by doing, not production-grade perfection.

🎯 Objectives

Build strong fundamentals in data analysis

Learn how to visualize data clearly and correctly

Practice exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Develop a problem-solving mindset using real datasets

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

NumPy – numerical operations

Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation

Matplotlib – core plotting

Seaborn – statistical visualizations


📈 What I Have Practiced

Line plots, bar charts, histograms

Handling missing values

Groupby and aggregation

Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

🧠 Learning Focus

This repository emphasizes:

Understanding the “why” behind each plot

Choosing the right visualization for the question

Writing short insights from graphs

Building analytical thinking, not just charts

🚀 Current Level

Beginner → Early Intermediate

Actively learning and improving

Code may not be optimized, but concepts are clear

📌 Future Plans

Improve data storytelling

Build dashboard-style visualizations

Add small end-to-end EDA projects

Explore interactive tools (Plotly / Power BI)
