# 🏏 IPL 2024 Data Analysis & Visualization (Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **mini data analysis project** based on the **IPL 2024 dataset**, created as part of my learning journey in Python data analysis and visualization.

The project focuses on extracting **basic insights** such as:
- Player of the Match
- Most wickets
- Top run scorers


This project was built by **following a YouTube tutorial**, with the objective of understanding the *workflow* of real-world data analysis rather than creating everything from scratch.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice data cleaning and exploration using Pandas
- Understand how to derive insights from sports data
- Learn how to visualize trends and comparisons
- Build confidence in handling real datasets

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – data cleaning & analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – basic visualizations  
- **Seaborn** – statistical plots  

---

## 📊 Key Insights Explored
- 🏆 Player of the Match analysis  
- 🎯 Most wickets taken by players  
- 🏏 Top run scorers  
- 📈 Team-wise performance trends  
- 📅 Match-level insights  

*(Insights depend on the dataset used and are for learning purposes.)*
